        Simple Social Syndication</a></h1>\n  <div class=\"subtitle\">\n  \n  <time>Published
        on 14 March 2013</time>\n  \n  \n  </div>\n  <p>\n    <p>I've been thinking
        about this for a while, but the recent <a href=\"http://googlereader.blogspot.ca/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html\">sunset\nannouncement
        of Google Reader</a> made me revisit this topic.\nGoogle Reader isn't the
        only thing that's dead. RSS (aka. Really Simple\nSyndication) has long been
        proclaimed dead as well. In fact most people\nnever even knew what RSS was.
        That said, it was a very useful tool for\nme and many others that like to
        stay up-to-date in their areas of\ninterest. Increasingly, I've been getting
        my dose of news through social\nnetworks. However, social networks contain
        a lot of noise that I care\nlittle for. I want to rebuild the RSS spirit using
        modern social\nnetworks. This post describes one possible approach, which
        I refer to as\n<strong>Really Simple Social Syndication (RSSS)</strong>.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2>Really
        simple syndication: the good old days</h2>\n\n<p>Here's what the content flow
        used to be with blogs and RSS:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"rss-flow.png\" alt=\"RSS-based
        content syndication\" /></p>\n\n<p>It was simple. Really simple, actually!</p>\n\n<h2>Social
        syndication: today</h2>\n\n<p>I don't care much for social networks. I mostly
        see them as a two-way\nutility for ultimately connecting content creators
        to content consumers.</p>\n\n<p>One way, social networks like Facebook, Twitter,
        G+, etc are just\nvehicles for finding out what to read based on your interests.
        I spend\ntoo much time checking them individually for my news, and this is\nunfortunate.
        </p>\n\n<p>The other way, social networks make it easier to have your content
        read\nby a bunch of the right people. In my case, the vast majority of\nnon-organic
        search traffic comes from social sources (mostly twitter). I\nwaste a bit
        of time tweeting, and G+ing new posts on my blog as they\ncome out, but sometimes
        they are picked up by others and I don't\nactually need to do that.</p>\n\n<p>As
        long as the content itself stays outside of the walled gardens of the\nsocial
        networks, I think we can come to a syndication solution that\nmight rival
        the old RSS-based one, but enjoy the benefits of having some\nextra signals
        from all of the social network junk. Here's the model I'm\nthinking of:</p>\n\n<p><img
        src=\"social-flow.png\" alt=\"Social-based content syndication\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now
        for a little bit more about Pub and Sub.</p>\n\n<h2>Sub: Requirements for
        consumption</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Reuse existing feeds</strong>. I
        don't want to re-create my sources. Use\nexisting people you follow on Twitter,
        from G+ circles, Facebook\nfriends.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>De-duplicated
        content</strong>. Some people post the same link on multiple\nnetworks. Some
        popular posts are reshared by everyone. I only want to\nsee a post once.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Content
        centric</strong>. Show me the content in some standard, readable\nway. Hide
        the social stuff unless I explicitly ask. Most of the time I\ndon't care where
        it came from, don't care how many people liked it, or\nwhat they wrote in
        the comments. Sometimes I'm curious and want a way\nto trace it back.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Social
        signals as a metric</strong>. If many of my sources share something,\nI probably
        should at least take a skim.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Web based service</strong>
        so that I can use it anywhere.</p></li>\n<li><p>Set a <strong>volume-based
        daily quota</strong>. If I'm busy today I'd like to only\nsee the top N articles,
        sorted by some transparent metric of my\nchoosing.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Flipboard,
        Pulse, Feedly all sort of fit into this class of readers.\nIdeally this would
        be an API that just lets me connect a few social\naccounts, and get back a
        filtered feed of content. This could be the API\nfor the product - a Really
        Simple Social Syndication (RSSS) feed.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone could then build a
        UI on top of it for their favorite platform\n(Google Reader-like).</p>\n\n<h2>Pub:
        Requirements for content production</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Automatically post
        content to a bunch of social services. </p></li>\n<li><p>Intelligent shortening
        of links and content (eg. for twitter, to fit\nin 140 chars).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Wordpress
        plugins, Tumblr and others provide ways to automatically tweet\nand otherwise
        post new updates to your content. There needs to be some\nother way that works
        in general for any type of content. Such a service\ncould be similar to feedburner,
        in that it would take an existing RSS\nfeed and socialize it.</p>\n\n<h2>Social
        networks, let's be friends!</h2>\n\n<p>I'm not religious about Google Reader
        or RSS. It was a good solution for\ncontent syndication at the time, but I'm
        ready to accept that perhaps\nit's time to move on. Hopefully with tools like
        the above, we can have\nsomething that comes close to the utility of RSS feeds.</p>\n\n<p>Social
        networks could do some evil stuff which would preclude RSSS from\nhappening.
        Economically, they are incentivized own content, create\nwalled gardens, insert
        advertisements, and prevent access to their\nfeeds. I'm hoping that some human
        element will prevent that from\nhappening.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a short list
        of what we need from the social networks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The content
        itself must be free from walled gardens (eg. paywalls,\nlogin walls, etc)</p></li>\n<li><p>Social
        network feeds are available to read in full, as is, without\nmagical suggestions,
        collaborative filtering, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Social networks provide some
        programmatic way to post content.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Once we have a good
        flow for the production and consumption of content,\nusing social networks
        as a delivery mechanism, I will be very happy to\nminimize the amount of time
        spent on social networks directly, and focus\non consuming and producing interesting
        things. Also, happy &pi; day!</p>\n\n  </p>\n\n  <div id=\"disqus_thread\"></div>\n
